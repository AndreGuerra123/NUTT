# NUTT - Newcastle University Ph.D. Thesis Template (LaTeX)

This unofficial template targets _Newcastle University_ (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/) Ph.D. students.

The template conforms to the _Guidelines for the Submission and Format of Theses_ (April 2015 version) hosted at http://www.ncl.ac.uk/students/progress/assets/documents/GuidelinesfortheSubmissionandFormatofThesis.pdf. Recently, a new document with the guideline was presented (January 2018 version) at http://www.ncl.ac.uk/students/progress/assets/documents/GuidelinesfortheSubmissionandFormatofThesis-January2018.pdf. However, no structural modifications were made.

Ph.D. students must allways check their School/Faculty restrictions under the above document, such as maximum word count.

## Declaration

This template was initially adapted from _CUED LaTeX template_ by Krishna Kumar, available at https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template (online). *Note* Some initial functionalities of the CUED template may not be working. Further testing may be necessary. 

Followed by the considerations  made in a previous _Newcastle University template_, by Matthew Forshaw, hosted at https://github.com/MattForshaw/NewcastleComputingSciencePhDTemplateLaTeX (offline).

The original template was modified accordingly to the Guidelines refered above, under the _Overleaf_ (https://www.overleaf.com/) platform (recommended), and then cloned here.
