# NUTT - Newcastle University Ph.D. Thesis Template (LaTeX)

This unofficial template targets _Newcastle University_ (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/) Ph.D. students.
The template conforms to the _Guidelines for the Submission and Format of Theses_ (April 2015 version) hosted at http://www.ncl.ac.uk/students/progress/assets/documents/GuidelinesfortheSubmissionandFormatofThesis.pdf. 
Ph.D. students must allways check their School/Faculty related restrictions under this document.

## Declaration

This template was initially adapted from _CUED LaTeX template_ by Krishna Kumar, available at https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template (online). Followed by the considerations  made in a previous _Newcastle University template_, by Matthew Forshaw, hosted at https://github.com/MattForshaw/NewcastleComputingSciencePhDTemplateLaTeX (offline).

The original template was modified accordingly to the Guidelines refered above, under the _Overleaf_ (https://www.overleaf.com/) platform (recommended), and then cloned here.

## Install
